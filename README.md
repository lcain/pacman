#Pac-Man!

Welcome to my first attempt at making a game! This is two and a half days of work, it's nowhere near perfect but it was so much fun and I learned a lot along the way! (And a lot of what not to do for next time!)

Thank you to everyone who helped me figure this out, all the input from mentors from the GA Slack channel (Charlie, Mike), and Kane for helping me to randomise my ghosts movements, Joel for spending 30 minutes going through my ghost movements with me to try and figure it out, and Jack for spending well over an hour figuring out how to get my ghosts to move properly and through the gaps in the maze. Watching Joel and Jack code and figure things out is pretty cool, you little insights in understanding the way they see things how to work things out. Thanks guys!

You'll need to refresh the screen to play again if you have a **"Game Over"**! 

***Have fun!***

>*Well, thereâ€™s not much entertainment in a game of eating, so we decided to create enemies to inject a little excitement and tension. The player had to fight the enemies to get the food. And each of the enemies has its own character. The enemies are four little ghost-shaped monsters, each of them a different colour - blue, yellow, pink and red. I used four different colours mostly to please the women who play - I thought they would like the pretty colours.*
